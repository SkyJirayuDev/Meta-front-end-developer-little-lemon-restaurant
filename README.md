# üçã Little Lemon Restaurant Website ‚Äì Meta Front-End Developer Capstone

This project is the final Capstone from the [Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) on Coursera. It‚Äôs a responsive front-end website for a fictional Mediterranean restaurant called **Little Lemon**, created to demonstrate practical front-end development skills using React and modern web technologies.

The website includes multiple pages such as a homepage, reservation form, and reusable components. It‚Äôs built with mobile-first responsive design, accessible navigation using React Router, and a clean layout styled with modern CSS techniques.

Technologies used in this project include:  
- **React 18** for building UI components  
- **React Router DOM 6** for multi-page navigation  
- **Font Awesome** (`@fortawesome/*`) for vector icons  
- **Modern Normalize** for consistent styling across browsers  
- **React Scripts 5** for development/build tools  
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for testing support  
- **Web Vitals** for measuring performance metrics

To run this project locally:  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Start the dev server with `npm start`  
Then open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

The project demonstrates how to:  
- Build modular and reusable React components  
- Create a responsive layout that adapts to all devices  
- Handle routing with `react-router-dom`  
- Use form elements and simple validation logic  
- Add iconography with Font Awesome  
- Prepare a React app for production with build scripts

This Capstone showcases practical, job-ready skills in front-end web development, and serves as a strong portfolio project for aspiring front-end developers.
